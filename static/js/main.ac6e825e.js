What should the team do first?","Option 1":"A) Ask the product owner to intervene in the conflict.","Option 2":"B) Add this executive to the team as a key stakeholder.","Option 3":"C) Discuss what should happen at the next retrospective.","Option 4":"D) Use Speed B Leas conflict management techniques.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"C","Explanation":"There is a lot happening here that could be beneficial to the project but could also be harmful\u2014the existing stakeholders could feel threatened, or the scope could be changing from what the stakeholders envisioned with the executive\u2019s inputs. The team needs to decide what to do, but with a clear consensus and expert judgment before taking action. A retrospective is about gaining insights for team improvement. All of the options could likely happen as well, but the first thing to do is discuss with the team. If the team agrees that further engagement is desirable, then the team could move on to reclassification of the stakeholder and any resulting conflict management."},{"#":13,"Question":"A project team is worried about product packaging and presentation. They receive a lot of negative feedback about this during iteration demos. How can the team improve their chances of customer acceptance?","Option 1":"A) Look through the customer\u2019s social media accounts and perform a qualitative analysis of customer attitudes towards packaging.","Option 2":"B) Investigate changes in the external business environment related to consumer attitudes about packaging.","Option 3":"C) Revise the definition of done (DoD) with the customer.","Option 4":"D) Find better options for packaging.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"C","Explanation":"Finding better packaging is definitely the goal in this scenario, but it\u2019s a question of how! Teams can research and recommend, and while project teams should always be aware of how external changes could impact their project, the customer is the first place to start to determine the criteria for what they will accept. The definition of done (DoD) must be agreed and updated to customer needs\u2014and this is subject to change in an adaptive project!"},{"#":14,"Question":"A project team is working in a remote location, and its operability is threatened due to severe supply chain disruption. This risk was listed in the risk register, but the severity of the disruption was not accounted for, so guidance on the response is minimal. What should the team do first?","Option 1":"A) Seek expert judgment on the matter and revise the risk response.","Option 2":"B) Focus on maintaining team coherence","Option 3":"C) Cancel the project.","Option 4":"D) Escalate to an organizational resource that can help.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"A","Explanation":"External enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) can often take us by surprise and pose serious threats, even with careful planning. In this case, the team should rely on expert judgment to figure out how to continue working as well as possible, given the difficult circumstances."},{"#":15,"Question":"A project manager meets frequently with a company\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) coordinator, because several members of the project team wear t-shirts on Fridays that others in the organization consider controversial. They are allowed to wear the shirts, but there are numerous complaints from around the company. What should the project manager do first?","Option 1":"A) Caution the team members about wearing the t-shirts to work.","Option 2":"B) Coach the team members on self-awareness.","Option 3":"C) Continue meeting with the DE&I coordinator.","Option 4":"D) Find out why they are wearing the t-shirts.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"B","Explanation":"Understanding the cultural contexts of the organization, its larger culture(s), and the individuals involved is essential in choosing the right course of action here. If the team members were not allowed to wear the shirts in the first place, then the easy answer is discipline, but since the team is permitted to wear the shirts, this potentially difficult situation risks getting a bit worse each Friday. The best course of action is to coach the team members on how to be more self-aware so they can understand how their actions may be causing others distress, even though the t-shirts are allowed. This answer is more transformational than any of the others and will provide better, longer lasting results."},{"#":16,"Question":"The executives, managers and coaches of a professional sports team often disagree. On a current project to create a VIP perks program, the product owner gets wildly conflicting inputs from the stakeholders \u2013\u20139 executives, managers and coaches. The product owner who is new to the organization asks the team for help on making decisions to create the initial product backlog. What should the team do?","Option 1":"A) Meet with the stakeholders to brainstorm, allow stakeholders to give their opinions and use active listening and expert judgment to note areas of agreement for use in creating user stories.","Option 2":"B) Interview the stakeholders separately and then the team and product owner can make the decisions.","Option 3":"C) Hold a kickoff meeting with all stakeholders, present the conflicting points of view and take notes on the whiteboard. These will become user stories.","Option 4":"D) Since the stakeholders can\u2019t agree, send them individual surveys to collect data, then write user stories and use voting techniques to prioritize them.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"A","Explanation":"Conflict is a part of decision-making, and it can be an important source of ideation in groups. Especially in an organizational culture that has a lot of inherent conflict, stakeholders may be accustomed to conflict as part of the culture. The kickoff meeting is not the place to resolve problems."},{"#":17,"Question":"A PMO in a large manufacturing company has been working diligently to retrain project managers and standardize software and templates across all projects, so that every project in the company will produce compliant artifacts. Which type of PMO is being described?","Option 1":"A) Supporting","Option 2":"B) Controlling","Option 3":"C) Directive","Option 4":"D) Agile Center of Excellence","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"B","Explanation":"Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. Compliance may involve adopting project management frameworks or methodologies; using specific templates, forms and tools; or conforming to governance. Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information and lessons learned from other projects. Directive PMOs take control of projects by directly managing the projects or shared resources, including project managers. A relatively small number of PMOs fall into this category. Agile Centers of Excellence (ACoE) or Value Delivery Offices (VDO) are emerging within organizations adopting more decentralized structures where teams need to respond quickly to changing customer needs. Their role is different, taking on coaching and mentoring efforts, rather than a managerial one."},{"#":18,"Question":"A company initiates a project to replace aging infrastructure by adopting an emerging green technology. The team is forming and having initial conversations about how to approach the project. Which THREE of the following will be helpful to the team? (Choose THREE)","Option 1":"A) Benefits Management Plan","Option 2":"B) Business Case","Option 3":"C) Initial Risk Assessment","Option 4":"D) Benefit-Cost Analysis","Option 5":"E) Team Charter","Right Answer":"B,C,E","Explanation":"The most helpful assets to a newly forming team on a project with high risk are the business case, an initial risk assessment, and the team charter. These documents state why the business needs or wants the project and helps determine the resources needed, the inherent risk in undertaking the project, and the terms of working together. The benefit-cost analysis helps compare the proposed benefits to the costs so, this is useful a bit later on. The benefits management plan should start to be formed at this stage, but this is a summary of what the expected benefits are from updating the infrastructure and adopting the new technology, as well as how they will be delivered to and measured by the business."},{"#":19,"Question":"A project team is brainstorming a complex issue with the prototype in development. They have consulted numerous experts in the field and together, have narrowed down the choice of possible actions to two. How should the team decide which action to take?","Option 1":"A) Empower the team lead to choose.","Option 2":"B) Choose based on lower cost.","Option 3":"C) Use the Delphi technique.","Option 4":"D) Review the project management plan.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"C","Explanation":"This team is cohesive and is doing the right things to problem-solve. They have already consulted the experts, as this is what the Delphi technique calls for so, there is reason to think they can continue to employ this unanimous decision-making method of consulting experts and arriving at a course of action based on their advice."},{"#":20,"Question":"An agile project team is working in an environment that is experiencing significant and disruptive upheaval. Team members are not performing well due to the stress, but work must continue. What should the team do?","Option 1":"A) Rely on the agile coach to focus the team on desired outcomes.","Option 2":"B) Ask the product owner to add time to the schedule.","Option 3":"C) Continue working as normal.","Option 4":"D) Examine project closure or cancellation options.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"A","Explanation":"If work must continue, then the answer is finding a way to focus on the work. Extending deadlines or pretending nothing is wrong can be risky. Examining project closure options may be a bit drastic at this stage."},{"#":21,"Question":"An executive in the company who is not a key project stakeholder of a project has expressed continued interest in the project and frequently gives their opinions directly to the project team. The key stakeholders are becoming annoyed and perceive the executive to be interfering, but the project team finds the executive\u2019s inputs helpful. Which TWO options are present in this situation? (Choose TWO)","Option 1":"A) An Intractable/War Situation, in the Leas Conflict Model","Option 2":"B) A Potential Conflict","Option 3":"C) Escalation Required","Option 4":"D) An Opportunity","Option 5":"E) An Impediment","Right Answer":"B,D","Explanation":"There is a potential conflict here between the key stakeholders and the executives \u2013 and also with the team. However, there is an opportunity present in the helpfulness of the executive\u2019s inputs."},{"#":22,"Question":"A virtual project team has been working together for a month. During this time, they have bonded a little, and then at an in-person team-building day, they finally meet each other. At this meeting, the team decides they would like to make a change to the weekly status meeting ground rules and include a little time for socializing. They think it will help to ease the feelings of isolation many of them express. The current team charter states that status team meetings are to be used for work purposes only. What should the project manager do first?","Option 1":"A) Allow the team to schedule a separate meeting during work hours for socializing.","Option 2":"B) Change the ground rules to allow socializing during the first 10 minutes only of weekly status meetings.","Option 3":"C) Schedule another collocated team-building event soon.","Option 4":"D) Poll team members to measure support for changing the ground rules.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"D","Explanation":"For a change to the ground rules, the team\u2019s consensus is key. All of the other choices are definitely possible but will impact the project negatively. A separate meeting would risk taking team focus away during working hours; changing the ground rules and limiting it would seem autocratic; another team-building event would be costly in time and money."},{"#":23,"Question":"An agile team is deployed to create a workable solution for helping a region with contaminated water supply. They are working with the government, contractors, and local residents to find the right technology to solve the problem. The product owner is trying to determine the urgency of the problem. How can the team help the product owner?","Option 1":"A) Research the market and make a list of available technologies.","Option 2":"B) Work with the local stakeholders to find out how much they are affected.","Option 3":"C) Determine the cost of a few solutions.","Option 4":"D) Find out how many people are affected.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"B","Explanation":"The customers in this project are the local stakeholders, and the team is responsible for finding out their needs and desired outcomes. The cost, available technologies, and number of people affected will determine the course of action, but the required sense of urgency can only be known by asking those affected."},{"#":24,"Question":"A project in a university to create a seed bank is complete. It was the first project used in the organization to use an agile approach. The deliverables were identified by the product owner. Some of the stakeholders are concerned about quality and have not signed off on the deliverables. What is the best way to collect feedback on the definition of done (DoD)?","Option 1":"A) Create a temporary wiki site for stakeholders to provide anonymous feedback.","Option 2":"B) Review all the lessons learned to evaluate strategic alignment.","Option 3":"C) Send a satisfaction survey and then set up a focus group.","Option 4":"D) Conduct a product review meeting with the concerned stakeholders.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"D","Explanation":"Direct and regular feedback from stakeholders is a normal feature of agile development approaches. Since this is the organization\u2019s first agile project, the stakeholders may not realize how the process relates to quality in an ongoing and continuous way. The best approach is to meet with them and review the product. Agile recommends face-to-face contact and colocation whenever possible."},{"#":25,"Question":"A project team has just successfully completed development of an underwater exploration device, which has cost more than $US3 billion to deliver. The company immediately orders five more units to be delivered, but with a budget of $US1 billion. The stakeholders\' reason for the reduced budget was since the technology has been developed, the project can be funded for building costs primarily, with a small amount for troubleshooting or development work. The stakeholders\u2019 priority is to recoup some financial value from the first project. How should the team and the product owner approach this situation?","Option 1":"A) Research the risk associated with the low budget for this work and present this to the stakeholders.","Option 2":"B) Explore with the stakeholders less risky ways to gain financial value from the first project.","Option 3":"C) Create a story map for the proposed development with the risks clearly accounted for in the work items.","Option 4":"D) Include a feature that addresses the risk approach to this work.","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"A","Explanation":"Since the stakeholders\u2019 priority is to recoup financial value from a previous project, their focus is on the money. You need to speak directly to them about the money, in this case how the low budget presents a risk that could create serious problems. Exploring other options will not address an additional risk inherent in this scenario\u2014that of unrealistic stakeholder expectations. Both of these are part of the steward\'s role in the project."},{"#":26,"Question":"A project manager is assessing the risks to a hybrid project in the execution stage. At the end of each iteration, the team has only reported normal issues such as equipment malfunctions. However, the team has recently alerted the project manager to a developing problem that signal regulatory noncompliance for the product. Which artifact should the project manager review and update?","Option 1":"A) Risk Register","Option 2":"B) Probability/Impact Matrix","Option 3":"C) Risk Management Plan","Option 4":"D) Product Technical Documentation","Option 5":"null","Right Answer":"A","Explanation":"Since noncompliance is a known risk area, the project manager can find information related to the management of this risk in the risk register. The probability/impact matrix will provide details of the consequences of the risk so, this will be useful after the risk has been assessed. The risk management plan and the technical documentation will contain helpful information, but not at this stage, when the project manager simply needs to know if the developing problem has escalated and poses the threat of becoming an issue."}]}');var r=o(579);function s(){var e,t,o,i,s;const[h,c]=(0,a.useState)([]),[l,d]=(0,a.useState)(null),[u,p]=(0,a.useState)([]),[m,g]=(0,a.useState)(0),[f,w]=(0,a.useState)(null),[y,v]=(0,a.useState)(!1);(0,a.useEffect)((()=>{console.log("Fetched categories:",n),n&&"object"===typeof n?c(Object.keys(n)):console.error("Invalid data format",n)}),[]);return(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"app-container",children:l?(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"quiz-container",children:[(0,r.jsxs)("h2",{children:[l," Quiz"]}),u.length>0?(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"question-section",children:[(0,r.jsx)("h3",{children:(null===(e=u[m])||void 0===e?void 0:e.question)||"Question not available"}),(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"choices-container",children:(null===(t=u[m])||void 0===t?void 0:t.choices)&&Object.entries(null===(o=u[m])||void 0===o?void 0:o.choices).map((e=>{let[t,o]=e;return(0,r.jsx)("button",{className:"choice-button "+(f===t?"selected":""),onClick:()=>(w(t),void v(!0)),children:o},t)}))}),y&&(0,r.jsxs)("p",{className:"explanation",children:[f===(null===(i=u[m])||void 0===i?void 0:i.correctAnswer)?"\u2705 Correct!
