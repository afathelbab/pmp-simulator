Two of the answer choices represent activities which are not associated with the planning process group, and, as a result, those responses can be eliminated. Both of the remaining answer choices represent reasonable actions that may have led to better stakeholder engagement. The development of the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix directly addresses the issue described by the question.

      "Explanation": "The output of every Sprint is called a Potentially Releasable Product Increment. It is the sum of the Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint. Delivering Potentially Releasable Product each Sprint is fundamental to the Scrum; since in agile, as work is divided into simple pieces, it can be finished in a short iteration. In Agile, â€œWorking software is the primary measure of progress. Final working software is produced in last sprint, not in every sprint, as asked in the question. Therefore, option A is ruled out. The product backlog is a living document that has anything and everything in relation to project work. It is the ordered list of all the work presented in story form for a team. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product owner is responsible for the product backlog. Therefore, option C is not correct. Agile development team is a cross-functional team (where developers, testers, QA, QC, etc.) work together to deliver an increment. Thus, option D makes no sense.

It is important that the resolution of conflicts be encouraged, promoting an open environment where team members are empowered to express their opinions and concerns about the project. However, when conflict becomes destructive, it may be appropriate and necessary for the scrum master to intervene. The appropriate action for the scrum master to take in this circumstance would be to take a break and address individuals in private. In the scenario, however, the conflict is still at its very beginning. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the conflict is going to escalate and become destructive. Therefore, at this point, no action is needed from the scrum master. To select the correct answer in this particular question, one should compare the situation described in the scenario with the wording of the available choices. \"Only if the conflict becomes destructive\" is the key part that makes intervening only if the conflict becomes destructive and taking a break if needed to address individuals privately the best answer to the question asked."

Backlog refinement is the progressive elaboration of project requirements (user stories) in which the team and relevant stakeholders, such as the productive owner, collaboratively review and update the requirements to satisfy customer needs. An iteration backlog is typically prioritized based on the value a user story represents for the customer combined with the risk associated with the user story. An outcome is a prioritized iteration backlog. As the work progresses, the product owner, together with the team, works with the stakeholders to prioritize the product backlog, identify new items, refine existing items, and clean up items that are no longer needed.

If 200 story points represent 1/2 of the total scope, then the total scope is 400 story points, leaving 200 story points remaining to be completed. Using the remaining number of story points on the project, 200, you need to multiply it by the average cost per story point, $500, to determine the expected cost for completing the remainder of the project. Following are the detailed calculations in this situation: Total story points completed = 200. Total story points remaining = 200. Average cost per story point = $500.

You have recommended the Agile project management approach to the client and they are happy with any management approach as long as they receive a working product. You and your team have a tough decision to make regarding sprint durations. A sprint duration of two weeks would add a lot of pressure on the team as complex requirements will be tough to build in a single sprint. A sprint duration of six weeks would make the project less Agile, but the project might get finished early as the customer will not get to see many prototypes. What sprint size should be selected?",

Classifications for stakeholder engagement may include unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, and leading.

Some teams and situations are extremely sensitive; project managers should be able to adapt to lead any kind of team or personality. Clearly, the project manager understands the need to motivate the team, but the question is how to do this in the right way. This is the opportunity presented by servant leadership, to understand how to effectively lead this team by example. Clearly, the team members are indicating their dissatisfaction with the project manager’s current method.

Project manager A tells a story about the last project, in which the team was given strict deadlines for updating artifacts and were audited to ensure risk registers and issue logs were updated at least once per week. Project manager B is shocked by project manager A’s story, because their project team is allowed to work independently, with very little reporting required. Which statement is true?",
      "Option 1": "A) Project manager B’s PMO has no project governance.",
